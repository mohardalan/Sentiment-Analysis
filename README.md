# Sentiment Analysis of Financial News Headlines

This project focuses on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify financial news headlines into one of three sentiments: Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The dataset used for this task can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/subashgandyer/datasets/main/financial_news_headlines_sentiment.csv).

## Steps

### 1. Download the Dataset
To get started, download the financial news headlines dataset from the provided link.

### 2. Load the Dataset
Load the dataset into your preferred environment or programming language for analysis.

### 3. Explore the Dataset (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the structure and characteristics of the dataset. Understand the distribution of sentiments and key features.

### 4. Clean the Data
Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing irrelevant information, and addressing any inconsistencies in the data.

### 5. Apply SMOTE for Imbalanced Data
Address imbalanced data issues by applying the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to create a balanced representation of the different sentiments.

### 6. Build a Bag of Words (BoW) Model
Construct a Bag of Words model to represent the textual data and extract features for further analysis.

### 7. Build a Tf-Idf Model
Implement a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (Tf-Idf) model to capture the importance of words in the dataset.

### 8. Split Train and Test Data
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models.

### 9. Use One ML Classifying Algorithm
Apply one machine learning classification algorithm to classify financial news headlines based on the features extracted from the BoW or Tf-Idf models.

### 10. Use Another ML Classifying Algorithm
Implement another machine learning classification algorithm to compare and contrast its performance with the first algorithm.

### 11. Plot Confusion Matrix
Visualize the performance of the classification algorithms by plotting confusion matrices, providing insights into the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
